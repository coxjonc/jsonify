Jsonify
=======

Jsonify is a python script that takes a .csv file as input and outputs a file with the same data in .json format. To use this program from the command line, enter the python shell and run the following commands::

    >> from jsonify import convert
    >> convert.jsonify('<your csv filename here>')

The script will generate a json file for you in the same directory with the same name as the original csv.
